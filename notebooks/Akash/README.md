We decided to mount the board at a right angle instead of laying them down flat to make the boards fit the 100 x 100 mm requirement. We also found this 4 switch DC/DC controller from TI.

We found this DC/DC controller from MPS. The MPQ4214GU which is a external 4 switch controller that is actually in stock.

Based on the sample application on the MPQ4214 datasheet, I am now calculating operating parameters.

This is the schematic for the DCDC controller IC based off of the given reference design. I still need to make sure that the operating parameters still fall within our  operating parameters.
