This report covers the design, manufacturing, and testing of a software-controlled DC/DC converter aimed for EV applications. Our project allows for control of up to 4 independent buck-boost converters over CAN, providing energy usage feedback and including automatic safety shutoff systems in the event of unsafe operation (eg:- overcurrent, overvoltage, overtemperature). The project accepts an input voltage range of 11-15V, and can produce 3.3V to 25V with a load current of up to 2A. It also includes the design of a custom GUI to control the converters and view data. Our project was unsuccessful in achieving a usable voltage conversion due to the limited testing time available during the semester. However, all communication and data platforms performed as expected, priming us for success with future revisions.
