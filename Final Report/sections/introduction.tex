A general section looks like this. There is usually a blurb introducing the top-level section here.

\subsection{Subsection 1}

Then you go into a subsection. In your text you can cite things like this \cite{ieee-ethics}, and reference other section such as appendices like Appendix \ref{appendix:a}.

\subsubsection{Sub-subsection 1}

Sometimes you will make use of subsubsections. Note: when you include figures and tables, I suggest using the [htb!] modifier.
