We were given a \$150 budget to complete this project, which we adhered to.
Our projected costs during the design phase were much lower than this figure, mostly due to us creating a very rough estimate before the system was fully fleshed out.
Once smaller components such as SMD capacitors and resistors were included, our costs quickly inflated.

\subsection{Labor}
Our estimates during design season of 3 junior engineers working for 15 hrs/week over 12 weeks was roughly in line with the actual work put into the project. 
With an average salary of \$40 per hour, this would come out to a man-hour cost of 540 hours, or \$21,600, before any benefits or taxes that have to be paid by the employer. 
This also represents the cost if the engineers are employed by the company needing the product, and the man-hour cost would likely be much higher if a company contracted another company to design such a product.
